# Build a web app that display the comics from Marvel API.

Feature must have:
- List all comics
- Can Search for any comic ( by title, no need to use API search, just search from fetched data)
- Can sort comics by title (A-Z)
- Have  pagination (Load more or scroll load)
- Can view a comic detail

Tech Stack:
- ReactJS. You can choose any UI framework bootstrap, Material design, for pure css/scss
- API from Marvel:
   + Sign up a Marvel account :    https://www.marvel.com/register?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.marvel.com%2Faccount        
   + Marvel API document : https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started

 Nice to have:

- The features work correctly and smooth
- Good project structure
- Can change layout ( Grid view <=> List view)
- Unit test
- Error control
- Server side rendering
